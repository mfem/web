<p>Many types of periodic flows can be found in nature and industrial applications and their computation is expensive due to lengthy time simulations. His work aims to reduce the cost of these computations. His team solves periodic flows in a space-time domain in which both ends in time are periodic such that they only have to model one period. MFEM is used to discretize the space-time domain and solve our discretized system of equations. Lotz applies a hyper-reduced Proper Orthogonal Decomposition Galerkin reduced order model to speed up our computations.

<p>Lazarov discussed recently added and ongoing code development facilitating the solution of shape and topology optimization problems. Both topology and shape optimization are gradient-based iterative algorithms aiming to find a material distribution that minimizes an objective and fulfills a set of constraints. Every optimization step includes a solution to a forward optimization problem, an evaluation of the objective and constraints, a solution to an adjoint problem associated with every objective or constraint, an evaluation of gradients, and an update of the design based on mathematical programming techniques. All these steps can be easily implemented and executed by using MFEM in a scalable manner, allowing the design and optimization of large-scale realistic industrial problems. Thus, the goal is to exemplify these features, highlight the techniques that simplify the implementation of new problems, and provide a glimpse into the future.</p>

<p>Heat conduction in magnetic confinement fusion can reach anisotropy ratios of 10^9-10^10, and in complex problems the direction of anisotropy may not be aligned with (or is impossible to align with) the spatial mesh. Such problems pose major challenges for both discretization accuracy and efficient implicit linear solvers. Although the underlying problem is elliptic or parabolic in nature, we argue that the problem is better approached from the perspective of hyperbolic operators. The problem is posed in a directional gradient first order formulation, introducing a directional heat flux along magnetic field lines as an auxiliary variable. We then develop novel continuous and discontinuous discretizations of the mixed system, using stabilization techniques developed for hyperbolic problems. The resulting block matrix system is then reordered so that the advective operators are on the diagonal, and the system is solved using AMG based on approximate ideal restriction (AIR), which is particularly efficient for upwind discretizations of advection. Compared with traditional discretizations and AMG solvers, we achieve orders of magnitude reduction in error and AMG iterations in the extremely anisotropic regime.</p>

<p>The focus of this talk is on presenting unconditionally stable, uniquely solvable, and convergent numerical methods to solve two classes of the sixth-order Cahn-Hilliard-type equations. The first class arises as the so-called phase field crystal atomistic model of crystal growth, which has been employed to simulate a number of physical phenomena such as crystal growth in a supercooled liquid, crack propagation in ductile material, dendritic and eutectic solidification. The second class, henceforth referred to as Microemulsion systems (ME systems) appears as a model capturing the dynamics of phase transitions in ternary oil-water-surfactant systems in which three phases namely a microemulsion, almost pure oil, and almost pure water can coexist in equilibrium. ME systems have several applications ranging from enhanced oil recovery to the development of environmentally friendly solvents and drug delivery systems. Despite the widespread applications of these models, the major challenge impeding their use has been and continues to be a lack of understanding of the complex systems which they model. Thus, building computational models for these systems is crucial to the understanding of these systems. The presence of the higher order derivative in combination with a time-dependent process poses many challenges to the creation of stable, convergent, and efficient numerical methods approximating solutions to these equations. In this talk, we present a continuous interior penalty Galerkin framework for solving these equations and theoretically establish the desirable properties of stability, unique solvability, and first-order convergence. We close the talk by presenting the numerical results of some benchmark problems to verify the practical performance of the proposed approach and discuss some exciting current and future applications.</p>

<p>Small matrix multiplications are a key building block of modern
high-order finite element method solvers. Such multiplications describe the act
of applying a specific finite element operator onto a set of state vectors. The
small and irregular size of these multiplications makes them poor candidates for
generic matrix multiplication routines. Moreover, for elements with a tensor
product construction, the operators themselves can exhibit a significant degree
of sparsity. In this talk, I will describe the code generation strategies
employed by our Fixed Size Sparse Matrix-Dense Matrix (FSSpMDM) routine in
libxsmm and show how these result in performant operator kernels for prismatic
and hexahedral elements. Strategies will be described for both x86-64
(AVX2/AVX-512) and AARCH64 (NEON/SVE) instruction sets. Results will be
presented on recent Intel and Apple CPUs and compared against the well-known
GiMMiK C code generation library.</p>

<p>Properly capture hurricane rapid intensification (where the winds
increase by 30 knots in the first 24 hours) remains challenging for atmospheric
models. The reason is that we need LES-type scales 𝒪(100m) which is still
elusive due to computational cost. In this talk, I describe the work that we are
doing in this area and how element-based Galerkin Methods are being used to
approximate spatial derivatives. I will also discuss the time-integration
strategy that we are exploring for this class of problems. In particular, we are
exploring process Multirate methods whereby each process in a system of
nonlinear partial different equations (PDEs) uses a time-integrator and
time-step commensurate with the wave-speed of that process. We have constructed
Multirate methods of any order using extrapolation methods. Along this same
idea, we have also developed a multi-modeling framework (MMF) designed to
replace the physical parameterizations used in weather/climate models. Our
approach is to view the coarse-scale and fine-scale models through the lens of
Variational Multi-Scale (VMS) methods in order to give MMF a more rigorous
mathematical foundation. Our end goal is to use MMF in order to better resolve
the inner core of hurricanes. In addition, I will show some results using flux
differencing discontinuous Galerkin Methods for constructing both Kinetic Energy
Preserving and Entropy Stable methods and discuss why we need scalable models in
order to achieve our goals.Our model, NUMA, is a 3D nonhydrostatic atmospheric
model that runs on large CPU clusters and on GPUs.</p>

<h5 id="april-25-2023-femllnl-seminar-series"><strong>April 25, 2023</strong> | <a href="https://mfem.org/seminar">FEM@LLNL Seminar Series</a></h5>
<p><img alt="YouTube" src="HboMmtGvCW4" /></p>
<p>The presented work started with a convergence and stability analysis for
the so-called full envelope approximation used in analyzing optical amplifiers
(lasers). The specific problem of interest was the simulation of Transverse
Mode Instabilities (TMI). The problem translates into the solution of a system
of two nonlinear time-harmonic Maxwell equations coupled with a transient
heat equation. Simulation of a 1 m long fiber involves the resolution of 10 M
wavelengths. A superefficient MPI/openMP hp FE code run on a supercomputer gets you
to the range of ten thousand wavelengths. The resolution of the additional
thousand wavelengths is done using an exponential ansatz e^{ikz} in the
z-coordinate. This results in a non-standard Maxwell problem.
The stability and convergence analysis for the problem has been restricted to
the linear case only. It turns out that the modified Maxwell problem is stable
if and only if the original waveguide problem is stable and the boundedness
below stability constants are identical. We have converged to the task of
determining the boundedness below constant.
The stability analysis started with an easier, acoustic waveguide problem.
Separation of variables leads to an eigenproblem for a self-adjoint
operator in the transverse plane (in x,y). Expansion of the solution
in terms of the corresponding eigenvectors leads then to a decoupled
system of ODEs, and a stability analysis for a two-point BVP for an ODE
parametrized with the corresponding eigenvalues. The L^2-orthogonality
of the eigenmodes and the stability result for a single mode, lead then
to the final result: the inverse boundedness below constant depends inversely
linearly upon the length L of the waveguide.
The corresponding stability for the Maxwell waveguide turned out to be
unexpectedly difficult. The equation is vector-valued so a direct separation
of variables is out to begin with. An exponential ansatz in z leads to
a non-standard eigenproblem involving an operator that is non-self
adjoint even for the easiest, homogeneous case. The answer to the problem
came from a tricky analysis of the eigenproblem combined with the perturbation
technique for perturbed self-adjoint operators. The use of perturbation
theory requires an assumption on the smallness of perturbation of
the dielectric constant (around a constant value) but with no additional
assumptions on its differentiability (discontinuities are allowed).
In the end, the final result is similar to that for the acoustic waveguide -
the boundedness below constant depends inversely linearly on L.</p>

<p>Electronic structure calculations, especially those using density functional theory (DFT), have been very useful in understanding and predicting a wide range of materials properties. The importance of DFT calculations to engineering and physical sciences is evident from the fact that ~20% of computational resources on some of the world's largest public supercomputers are devoted to DFT calculations. Despite the wide adoption of DFT, the state-of-the-art implementations of DFT suffer from cell-size and geometry limitations, with the widely used codes in solid state physics being limited to periodic geometries and typical simulation domains containing a few hundred atoms.
This talk will present our recent advances towards the development of computational methods and numerical algorithms for conducting fast and accurate large-scale DFT calculations using adaptive finite-element discretization, which form the basis for the recently released <a href="https://github.com/dftfeDevelopers/dftfe">DFT-FE open-source code</a>. Details of the implementation, including mixed precision algorithms and asynchronous computing, will be presented. The computational efficiency, scalability and performance of DFT-FE will be presented, which demonstrates a significant outperformance of widely used plane-wave DFT codes.</p>

<p>To improve tsunami preparedness, early-alert systems and real-time monitoring are essential. We use a novel approach for predictive tsunami modeling within the Bayesian inversion framework. This effort focuses on informing the immediate response to an occurring tsunami event using near-field data observation. Our forward model is based on a coupled acoustic-gravity model (e.g., Lotto and Dunham, Comput Geosci (2015) 19:327—340). Similar to other tsunami models, our forward model relies on transient boundary data describing the location and magnitude of the seafloor deformation. In a real-time scenario, these parameter fields must be inferred from a variety of measurements, including observations from pressure gauges mounted on the seafloor. One particular difficulty of this inference problem lies in the accurate inversion from sparse pressure data recorded in the near-field where strong hydroacoustic waves propagate in the compressible ocean; these acoustic waves complicate the task of estimating the hydrostatic pressure changes related to the forming surface gravity wave. Our space-time model is discretized with finite elements in space and finite differences in time. The forward model incurs a high computational complexity, since the pressure waves must be resolved in the 3D compressible ocean over a sufficiently long time span. Due to the infeasibility of rapidly solving the corresponding inverse problem for the fully discretized space-time operator, we discuss approaches for using compact representations of the parameter-to-observable map.</p>

<p>The Diffusion equation with strong anisotropy has broad applications. In this project, we discuss numerical solution of diffusion equations with strong anisotropy on meshes not aligned with the anisotropic vector field, focusing on application to magnetic confinement fusion. In order to resolve the numerical pollution for simulations on a non-anisotropy-aligned mesh and reduce the associated high computational cost, we developed a high-order discontinuous Galerkin scheme with an efficient preconditioner. The auxiliary space preconditioning framework is designed by employing a continuous finite element space as the auxiliary space for the discontinuous finite element space. An effective line smoother that can mitigate the high-frequency error perpendicular to the magnetic field has been designed by a graph-based approach to pick the line smoother that is approximately perpendicular to the vector fields when the mesh does not align with anisotropy. Numerical experiments for several benchmark problems are presented to validate the effectiveness and robustness.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://fenicsproject.org/">FEniCS Project</a> provides libraries for solving partial differential equations using the finite element method. An aim of the FEniCS Project has been to provide high-performance solver environments that closely mirror mathematical syntax, with the hypothesis that high-level representations means that solvers are faster to write, easier to debug, and can deliver faster runtime performance than is reasonably possible by hand. Using domain-specific languages and code generation techniques, arguably the FEniCS libraries delivered on these goals for a set of problems. However, over time limitations, including performance and extensibility, become clear and maintainability/sustainability became an issue.Building on experiences from the FEniCS libraries, I will present and discuss the design on the next generation of tools, FEniCSx. The new design retains strengths of the past approach, and addresses limitations using new designs and new tools. Solvers can be written in C++ or Python, and a number of design changes allow the creation of flexible, fast solvers in Python. In the second part of my presentation, I will discuss high-performance finite element kernels (limited to CPUs on this occasion), motivated by the Center for Efficient Exascale Discretizations 'bake-off' problems, and which would not have been possible in the original FEniCS libraries. Double, single and half-precision kernels are considered, and results include (i) the observation that kernels with vector intrinsics can be slower than auto-vectorised kernels for common cases, and (ii) a cache-aware performance model which is remarkably accurate in predicting performance across architectures.</p>

<p>Heart diseases are an ubiquitous societal burden responsible for a majority of deaths world wide. A central problem in developing effective treatments for heart diseases is the inherent complexity of the heart as an organ. From a modeling perspective, the heart can be interpreted as a biological pump involving multiple physical fields, namely fluid and solid mechanics, as well as chemistry and electricity, all interacting on different time scales. This multiphysics and multiscale aspect makes simulations inherently expensive, especially when approached with naive numerical techniques. However, computational models can be extraordinarily useful in helping us understanding how the healthy heart functions and especially how malfunctions influence different diseases. In this context, also information about possible weaknesses of therapies can be obtained to ultimately improve clinical treatment and decision support. In this talk, we will focus primarily on two important model classes in computational cardiology and their respective efficient numerical treatment without compromising significant accuracy. The first class is the problem of computing electrocardiograms (ECG) from electrical heart simulations. Since ECG measurements can give a wide range of insights about a wide range of heart diseases they offer suitable data to validate our electrophysiological models and verify our numerical schemes on organ-scale. Known numerical issues, arising in the context of electrophysiological models, will be reviewed. The second class addresses bidirectionally coupled electromechanical models and their efficient numerical treatment. Focus will be on a unified space-time adaptive operator splitting framework developed on top of MFEM which proves highly efficient so far for the investigated model classes while still preserving high accuracy.</p>

<p>The advent of new powerful deep neural networks (DNNs) has fostered their application in a wide range of research areas, including more recently in fluid mechanics. In this presentation, we will cover some of the fundamentals of deep learning applied to computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Furthermore, we explore the capabilities of DNNs to perform various predictions in turbulent flows: we will use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for non-intrusive sensing, i.e. to predict the flow in a turbulent open channel based on quantities measured at the wall. We show that it is possible to obtain very good flow predictions, outperforming traditional linear models, and we showcase the potential of transfer learning between friction Reynolds numbers of 180 and 550. We also discuss other modelling methods based on autoencoders (AEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), and we present results of deep-reinforcement-learning-based flow control.</p>

<p>Predictive simulation increasingly involves the dynamics of complex systems with multiple interacting physical processes. In designing simulation tools for these problems, both the formulation of individual constituent solvers, as well as coupling of such solvers into a cohesive simulation tool must be addressed. In this talk, I discuss both of these aspects in the context of fluid-structure interaction, where we have recently developed a new class of stable and accurate partitioned solvers that overcome added-mass instability through the use of so-called compatibility boundary conditions. Here I will present partitioned coupling strategies for incompressible FSI. One interesting aspect of CBC-based coupling is the occurrence of nonstandard and/or high-derivative operators, which can make adoption of the techniques challenging, e.g. in the context of FEM methods. To address this, I will also discuss our newly developed Galerkin Difference approximations, which may provide a natural pathway for CBCs in an FEM context. Although GD is fundamentally a finite element approximation based on a Galerkin projection, the underlying GD space is nonstandard and is derived using profitable ideas from the finite difference literature. The resulting schemes possess remarkable properties including nodal superconvergence and the ability to use large CFL-one time steps. I will also present preliminary results for GD discretizations on unstructured grids using MFEM.</p>

<p>We consider design, development, and use of simulation software for exascale computing, with a particular emphasis on fluid dynamics simulation. Our perspective is through the lens of the high-order code Nek5000/RS, which has been developed under DOE's Center for Efficient Exascale Discretizations (CEED). Nek5000/RS is an open source thermal fluids simulation code with a long development history on leadership computing platforms—it was the first commercial software on distributed memory platforms and a Gordon Bell Prize winner on Intel's ASCII Red. There are a myriad of objectives that drive software design choices in HPC, such as scalability, low-memory, portability, and maintainability. Throughout, our design objective has been to address the needs of the user, including facilitating data analysis and ensuring flexibility with respect to platform and number of processors that can be used. When running on large-scale HPC platforms, three of the most common user questions are: How long will my job take? How many nodes will be required? Is there anything I can do to make my job run faster? Additionally, one might have concerns about storage, post-processing (Will I be able to analyze the results? Where?), and queue times. This talk will seek to answer several of these questions over a broad range of fluid-thermal problems from the perspective of a Nek5000/RS user. We specifically address performance with data for NekRS on several of the DOE's pre-exascale architectures, which feature AMD MI250X or NVIDIA V100 or A100 GPUs.</p>

<p>Many of the most interesting phenomena in solid mechanics occurs at material interfaces. This can be in the form of fluid structure interaction, cracks, material discontinuities, impact etc. Solutions to these problems often require some form of immersed/embedded boundary method or contact or combination of both. This talk will provide a brief overview of different lab efforts in these areas and presents some of the current research aspects and results using from LLNL production codes. Technically speaking, the methods discussed here all require Lagrange multipliers to satisfy the constraints on the interface of overlapping or dissimilar meshes which complicates the solution. Stability and consistency of Lagrange multiplier approaches can be hard to achieve both in space and time. For example, the wrong choice of multiplier space will either be over-constrained and/or cause oscillations at the material interfaces for simple statics problems. For dynamics, many of the basic time integration schemes such as Newmark's method are known to be unstable due to gaps opening and closing. Here we introduce some (non-Nitsche) stabilized multiplier spaces for immersed boundary and contact problems and a structure preserving time integration scheme for long time dynamic contact problems. Finally, I will describe some on-going efforts extending this work.</p>

CHyPS uses MFEM to provide the underlying discontinuous Galerkin spatial discretization and linear solvers used to solve the equations. In this talk, we will briefly present the physics and corresponding equations governing material response in hypersonic environments. We will also include a discussion on the implementation of a direct Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian approach to handle mesh movement resulting from the ablation of the material surface. Results for standard community test cases developed at a series of Ablation Workshop meetings over the past decade will be presented and compared to other material response solvers. We will also show the potential of high-order solutions for simulating thermal protection system material response.</p>

<p>Unsteady partial differential equations on deforming domains appear in many real-life scenarios, such as wind turbines, helicopter rotors, car wheels, free-surface flows, etc. We will focus on the space-time finite element method, which is an excellent approach to discretize problems on evolving domains. This method uses discontinuous Galerkin to discretize both in the spatial and temporal directions, allowing for an arbitrarily high-order approximation in space and time. Furthermore, this method automatically satisfies the geometric conservation law, which is essential for accurate solutions on time-dependent domains. The biggest criticism is that the application of space-time discretization increases the computational complexity significantly. To overcome this, we can use the high-order accurate Hybridizable or Embedded discontinuous Galerkin method. Numerical results will be presented to illustrate the applicability of the method for fluid flow around rigid bodies.</p>

<p>Two operations take function spaces and make them suitable for finite element computations. The first is the construction of trace-free subspaces (which creates "bubble" functions) and the second is the extension of functions from cell boundaries into cell interiors (which create edge functions with the correct continuity): together these operations define the <em>geometric decomposition</em> of a function space. In finite element exterior calculus (FEEC), these two operations have been treated separately for the two main families of finite elements: full polynomial elements and trimmed polynomial elements. In this talk we will see how one constructor of trace-free functions and one extension operator can be used for both families, and indeed for all differential forms. We will also examine the practicality of these two operators as tools for implementing geometric decompositions in actual finite element codes.</p>

<p>An axisymmetric model leads, when suitable, to a substantial cut in the computational cost with respect to a 3D model. Although not as accurate, the axisymmetric model allows to quickly obtain a result which can be satisfying. Simple modifications to a 2D finite element solver allow to obtain an axisymmetric solver. We present MFEM-based parallel axisymmetric solvers for different problems. We first present simple axisymmetric solvers for the Laplacian problem and the heat equation. We then present an axisymmetric solver for the compressible Navier-Stokes equations. All solvers are based on H^1-conforming finite element spaces. The correctness of the implementation is verified with convergence tests on manufactured solutions. The Navier-Stokes solver is used to simulate axisymmetric flows with an analytical solution (Poiseuille and Taylor-Couette) and an air flow in a plasma torch geometry.</p>

<p>As additively manufactured (AM) parts become increasingly more popular in industry, a growing need exists to help expediate the certifying process of parts. The ExaAM project seeks to help this process by producing a workflow to model the AM process from the melt pool process all the way up to the part scale response by leveraging multiple physics codes run on upcoming exascale computing platforms. As part of this workflow, ExaConstit is a next-generation quasi-static, solid mechanics FEM code built upon MFEM used to connect local microstructures and local properties within the part scale response. Within this talk, we will first provide an overview of ExaConstit, how we have ported it over to the GPU, and some performance numbers on a number of different platforms. Next, we will discuss how we have leveraged MFEM and the FLUX workflow to run hundreds of high-fidelity simulations on Summit in-order to generate the local properties needed to drive the part scale simulation in the ExaAM workflow. Finally, we will show case a few other areas ExaConstit has been used in.</p>

<p>Immersed/embedded/unfitted boundary methods obviate the need for continual re-meshing in many applications involving rapid prototyping and design. Unfortunately, many finite element embedded boundary methods are also difficult to implement due to the need to perform complex cell cutting operations at boundaries, and the consequences that these operations may have on the overall conditioning of the ensuing algebraic problems. We present a new, stable, and simple embedded boundary method, named “shifted boundary method” (SBM), which eliminates the need to perform cell cutting. Boundary conditions are imposed on a surrogate discrete boundary, lying on the interior of the true boundary interface. We then construct appropriate field extension operators, by way of Taylor expansions, with the purpose of preserving accuracy when imposing the boundary conditions. We demonstrate the SBM on large-scale solid and fracture mechanics problems; thermomechanics problems; porous media flow problems; incompressible flow problems governed by the Navier-Stokes equations (also including free surfaces); and problems governed by hyperbolic conservation laws.</p>

<p>Ben Zwick of the University of Western Australia presented "Solution of the Electroencephalography (EEG) Forward Problem." The brain's electrical activity can be measured using EEG with electrodes attached to the scalp, or electrocorticography (ECoG), also known as intracranial EEG (iEEG), with electrodes implanted on the brain's surface. EEG source localization combines measurements from EEG or iEEG with data from medical imaging to estimate the location and strengths of the current sources that generated the measured electric potential at the electrodes. Source localization can be used to locate the epileptic zone in pharmaco-resistant focal epilepsies and study evoked related potentials. Accurate source localization requires fast and accurate solutions of the EEG forward problem, which involves calculating the electric potential within the brain volume given a predefined source. This presentation demonstrates how MFEM can be used to solve the EEG forward problem using patient-specific geometry and tissue conductivity obtained from medical images.</p>

<p>Tobias Duswald of CERN/Technical University of Munich presented "Stochastic Fractional PDEs with MFEM with Applications to Random Field Generation and Topology Optimization." Over the last several centuries, engineers, physicists, and mathematicians have learned how to describe their problems accurately with partial differential equations (PDEs). PDEs govern the laws of continuum mechanics, quantum mechanics, heat transfer, and many other phenomena. More recently, fractional PDEs have gained popularity in the scientific community because they allow for a more general description of complicated systems (e.g., multiphysics) by leveraging a real-valued exponent for the operators. Besides fractional operators, stochastic PDEs have also sparked the community's interest because they generalize the PDE framework to account for randomness appearing in many disciplines. This talk addresses the numerical solution of stochastic, fractional PDEs with MFEM. To deal with these two flavors of PDEs, Duswald introduced MFEM’s WhiteNoiseIntegrator to treat a stochastic linear form and adopt a rational approximation for the fractional operator. He presented results for three different use cases. First, he showed numerical results for the fractional Laplace problem with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. Second, he generated Matérn-type Gaussian random fields (GRFs) by solving a specific stochastic, fractional PDE using an approach commonly referred to as SPDE method in the spatial statistics literature. Thirdly, he used GRFs to model geometric uncertainties in additive manufacturing processes and apply the model for topology optimization under uncertainty.</p>

<p>Alvaro Sánchez Villar of the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory presented "MFEM Application to EM-Wave Simulation in ECR Space Plasma Thrusters." The solution of Maxwell equations using the cold-plasma approximation is shown in the context of the design of electron cyclotron resonance plasma thrusters for space propulsion applications. This thruster class utilizes the electron cyclotron resonance to energize the plasma constituents and to sustain the plasma discharge. MFEM finite element discretization is used to solve for the time-harmonic electromagnetic waves. The shape and magnitude of the electromagnetic power density absorbed by the plasma is coupled to the plasma transport variables, and therefore determines the thruster operation performance parameters. Coupled simulations of the electromagnetic-wave and the plasma transport problems are used to interpret thruster operational principles, to understand its sensitivity to operational and design parameters, and compared to experimental measurements to both assess the accuracy of the current numerical model and to highlight its main limitations.</p>

<p>Christina Migliore of MIT presented "The Development of the EM RF-Edge Interactions Mini-App Stix Using MFEM." Ion cyclotron radio frequency range (ICRF) power plays an important role in heating and current drive in fusion devices. However, experiments show that in the ICRF regime there is a formation of a radio frequency (RF) sheath at the material and antenna boundaries that influences sputtering and power dissipation. Given the size of the sheath relative to the scale of the device, it can be approximated as a boundary condition (BC). Electromagnetic field solvers in the ICRF regime typically treat material boundaries as perfectly conducting, thus ignoring the effect of the RF sheath. Here it is described progress of implementing a model for the RF sheath based on a finite impedance sheath BC formulated by J. Myra and D. A. D’Ippolito, Physics of Plasmas 22 (2015) which provides a representation of the RF rectified sheath including capacitive and resistive effects. This research will discuss the results from the development of a parallelized cold-plasma wave equation solver Stix that implements this non-linear sheath impedance BC through the method of finite elements in pseudo-1D and pseudo-2D using the MFEM library.</p>

<p>Siu Wun Cheung of LLNL presented "Reduced Order Modeling for Finite Element Simulations Through the Partnership of MFEM and libROM." MFEM provides a wide variety of mesh types and high-order finite element discretizations. However, subject to the model complexity and fine resolution of the discretization, the computational cost can be high, requiring a long time to complete a single forward simulation. In this talk, we will introduce various reduced order modeling techniques, which aim to lower the computational complexity and maintain good accuracy, including intrusive projection-based model reduction and non-intrusive approaches. We will demonstrate the use of reduced order modeling techniques in libROM (www.librom.net), which can be applied to various MFEM examples, including the Poisson problem, linear elasticity, linear advection, mixed nonlinear diffusion, nonlinear elasticity, nonlinear heat conduction, Euler equation, and optimal control problems.</p>

<p>Devlin Hayduke of ReLogic Research presented "Project Minerva: Accelerated Deployment of MFEM Based Solvers in Large Scale Industrial Problems." While many Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) supported software packages are open source, they are often complicated to use, distributed primarily in source-code form targeting HPC systems, and potential adopters lack options for purchasing commercial support, training, and custom-development services. In response to this need, ReLogic Research, Inc., in collaboration with LLNL, is developing a secure, cloud deployable platform based on the MFEM software termed Minerva. Minerva will feature an integration layer allowing users of commercially available finite element pre/post-processing software (e.g., Abaqus/CAE, Hypermesh, Femap) for use with the Abaqus solver to run simulation studies with the MFEM discretization library and will strengthen further MFEM implemented solvers to make them applicable for solving large scale industrial design and optimization problems.</p>

<p>Tim Brewer, Ben Shields, Peter Vonk, Jeff Heylmun, and Barlev Raymond of Synthetik Applied Technologies presented "blastFEM: A GPU-Accelerated, Very High-Performance and Energy-Efficient Solver for Highly Compressible Flows." Highly compressible multiphase and reactive flows are important, and manifest across a myriad of practical applications: novel energy production and propulsion methods, building design, safety and energy efficiency, material discovery, and maintenance of our nuclear arsenal. There are, however, few tools available to industry capable of simulating these flows at a resolution and scale suitable make predictions of adequate detail—at least within reasonable timeframes and budgetary constraints—to inform engineers and designers. A next generation, highly efficient simulation code is needed that can deliver results within useful timeframes, with sufficient detail to be useful to support simulation-driven design, discovery, and optimization. Furthermore, the code must be designed to run on modern and emerging heterogeneous architectures, and can efficiently leverage these architectures though the use of numerical schemes designed to maximized computational efficiency.</p>

<p>LLNL research scientist John Camier described recent improvements of high-order finite element CUDA kernels that can reduce the time-to-solution by a factor of 10. Augmenting traditional compiler representations with a general mathematical description enables a sustainable way to generate optimized kernels, matching the peak performance of hand-tuned CUDA code. Such intermediate graph-based representation provides significant potential for optimization, both in terms of minimizing the number of kernel launches and in reducing the memory bandwidth. Camier also presented results on single and multiple GPUs that demonstrate significant reduction in the local problem size required to reach peak performance, leading to faster time-to-solution in finite element applications.</p>

<p>William Dawn from North Carolina State University described his work with unstructured neutron transport. His team models microreactors, a new class of compact reactor with relatively small electrical output. As part of the Exascale Computing Project, Dawn’s team is modeling the MARVEL reactor, which is planned for construction at Idaho National Laboratory. MFEM satisfies their need for a finite element framework with GPU support and rapid prototyping. With MFEM, the team discretizes a neutron transport equation with six independent variables in space, direction, and energy.</p>
<p>Traditional neutron transport methods use a “sweeping” method to transport particles through a problem, but this is not feasible for generally unstructured meshes. In Dawn’s models, the Self-Adjoint Angular Flux (SAAF) form of the neutron transport equation is used to transform the neutron transport equation from a first-order hyperbolic form to a second-order elliptic form. Then, the SAAF equations are discretized with the finite element method and solved using MFEM. Due to the dependence of the neutron flux on angle and direction, these problems have a high vector-dimension with hundreds to thousands of degrees of freedom (DOF) per mesh vertex. Also, due to the second-order nature of these equations, highly refined meshes are required to sufficiently resolve reactor geometries with millions of vertices in a mesh. Results have been prepared for problems with billions of DOF using the Summit supercomputer at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.</p>

<p>Syun’ichi Shiraiwa of Pacific Northwest National Laboratory introduced PyMFEM, a Python wrapper for MFEM that his team uses in radiofrequency (RF) wave simulations for the RF-SciDAC project. RF waves can be used to heat plasma in a nuclear fusion reaction. Simulations of this process present multiple challenges when incorporating a variety of antenna structures at different frequencies, waves with different wave lengths in the same space or spatially diverse, and RF wave effects on background plasma. To integrate MFEM, a C++ software library, into their multiphysics platform, Shiraiwa’s team created a code “wrapper” that binds MFEM to the external Python components of RF wave simulations, ultimately extending MFEM’s features to Python users. Shiraiwa described how the PyMFEM module works in serial and parallel and invited the audience to contribute to the open-source code.</p>

<p>Jan Nikl outlined how his team at the ELI Beamlines Centre uses MFEM for laser plasma modeling. Lasers have found their application in many scientific disciplines, where generation of plasma, the fourth state of matter, holds great potential for the future. A detailed description of laser produced plasmas is then essential for many applications, like (pre)pulses of ultra-intense lasers and ion acceleration beamlines, laboratory astrophysics, inertial confinement fusion, and many others. All of the mentioned are investigated at ELI Beamlines in the Czech Republic, a European laser facility aiming to operate the most intense laser system in the world. In this context, Nikl described the numerical construction based on the finite element method. This effort concentrates mainly on the Lagrangian hydrodynamics and Vlasov–Fokker–Planck–Maxwell kinetic description of plasma, utilizing the MFEM library for its flexibility and scalability.</p>

<p>Mathias Davids from Harvard Medical School presented MFEM’s use in a medical setting. Peripheral nerve stimulation (PNS) limits the usable image encoding performance in the latest generation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners. The rapid switching of the MRI gradient coils’ magnetic fields induces electric fields in the human body strong enough to evoke unwanted action potential in peripheral nerves, leading to muscle contractions or touch perceptions. Despite its limiting role in MRI, PNS effects are not directly included during the coil design phase. Davids’ team developed a modeling tool to predict PNS thresholds and locations in the human body, allowing them to directly incorporate PNS metrics in the numeric coil winding optimization to design PNS-optimized coil layouts. This modeling tool relies on electromagnetic field simulations in heterogeneous finite element body models coupled to neurodynamic models of myelinated nerve fibers. This tool enables researchers to develop strategies that mitigate PNS effects without building expensive prototype MRI systems, maximizing the usable image encoding performance.</p>

The solver uses the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method as a space discretization and an explicit Runge-Kutta time-integration scheme. An effort has been made to fully support GPU computation by taking over some of the loops internal to the NonLinearForm class.

Robert Rieben described the variety of mathematical algorithms needed for these simulations, including ALE methods, unstructured adaptive mesh refinement, and high-order discretizations. LLNL’s Multiphysics on Advanced Platforms Project (MAPP) is developing a next-generation multiphysics code, called MARBL, based on high-order numerical methods and modular infrastructure for deployment on advanced HPC architectures. MARBL’s use of high-order methods produce better throughput on GPUs. MARBL uses MFEM for finite elements and mesh/field/operator abstractions while leveraging its support for efficient memory management.

<p>Three undergraduate students—Felipe Gómez, Carlos del Valle, and Julián Jiménez—from the National University of Colombia presented their work using MFEM in an oceanographic model. Below the Arctic sea ice, and under the right conditions, a flux of icy brine flows down into the sea. The icy brine has a much lower fusion point and a higher density than normal seawater. As a result, it sinks while freezing everything around it, forming an ice channel called a brinicle (also known as ice stalactite). The team shared their simulations of this phenomenon assuming cylindrical symmetry. The fluid is considered viscous and quasi-stationary, and the problem is simulated taking advantage of the setup symmetries. The heat and salt transport are weakly coupled to the fluid motion and are modeled with the corresponding conservation equations, taking into account diffusive and convective effects. The coupled system of partial differential equations is discretized and solved with the help of the MFEM finite element library.</p>

<p>Thomas Helfer from the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) introduced the MFEM-MGIS-MFront library (MMM), which aims for efficient use of supercomputers in the field of implicit nonlinear thermomechanics. His team’s primary focus is to develop advanced nuclear fuel element simulations where the evolution of materials under irradiation are influenced by multiple phenomena (e.g., viscoplasticity, damage, phase transitions, swelling due to solid and gaseous fission products). MFEM provides this project with finite element abstractions, adaptive mesh refinement, and a parallel API. However, as applications dedicated to solid mechanics in MFEM are mostly limited to a few constitutive equations such as elasticity and hyperelasticity, Helfer explained that his team extended the software’s functionality to cover a broader spectrum of mechanics. Thus, this MMM project combines MFEM with the MFrontGenericInterfaceSupport (MGIS), an open-source C++ library that provides data structures to support arbitrarily complex nonlinear constitutive equations generated by the MFront code generator. MMM is developed within the scope of CEA’s PLEIADES project. Helfer’s presentation provided (1) an introduction to MMM goals; (2) a tutorial of MMM usage with a focus on the high-level user interface; (3) an overview of the core design choices of MMM and how MFEM was extended to support a range of scenarios; and (4) feedback on the two main issues encountered during MMM development.</p>
