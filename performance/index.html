<h1 id="performance-and-partial-assembly">Performance and Partial Assembly</h1>
<p>This document provides a brief overview of the tensor-based high-performance
and partial assembly features in MFEM. In the traditional finite element
setting, the operator is assembled in the form of a matrix. The action of the
operator is computed by multiplying with this matrix. At high orders this
requires both a large amount of memory to store the matrix, as well as many
floating point operations to compute and apply it. <em>Partial assembly</em> is a
technique that allows for efficiently applying the action of finite element
operators without forming the corresponding matrix. This is particularly
important when running on GPUs.</p>
<p>Partial assembly is enabled at the level of the <code>BilinearForm</code> by setting
the assembly level:</p>
<pre><code class="c++">a-&gt;SetAssemblyLevel(AssemblyLevel::PARTIAL);
</code></pre>

<p>Once partial assembly is enabled, subsequent calls to member functions such as
<code>FormLinearSystem</code> will result in an <code>Operator</code> that represents the action of
the bilinear form <code>a</code>, without assembling a matrix. This functionality is
illustrated in several <a href="../examples/">MFEM examples</a>, including examples 1, 3, 4,
5, 6, 9, 24, and 26.</p>
<p>Note that partial assembly is currently implemented for tensor-product elements
(i.e. quadrilaterals and hexahedra). Partial assembly for simplex elements
(triangles and tetrahedra) is planned.</p>
<h2 id="preconditioning-with-partial-assembly">Preconditioning with Partial Assembly</h2>
<p>When using partial assembly, the system matrix is no longer available for
constructing preconditioners. This means that some of the standard
preconditioners in MFEM such as <code>HypreBoomerAMG</code> and <code>GSSmoother</code> cannot be
used.</p>
<p>MFEM allows for the efficient construction of diagonal (Jacobi) smoothers for
partially assembled operators on quad and hex meshes using the class
<code>OperatorJacobiSmoother</code>. This class efficiently assembles the diagonal of the
corresponding matrix, exploiting the tensor-product structure for efficient
evaluation.</p>
<p>MFEM also allows for <a href="http://netlib.org/linalg/html_templates/node76.html">Chebyshev
smoothing</a> with partial
assembly using the class <code>OperatorChebyshevSmoother</code>. This smoother uses
estimates of the eigenvalues of the operator computed using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_iteration">power
method</a>, and is built upon the
functionality of <code>OperatorJacobiSmoother</code>.</p>
<p>Very efficient partially assembled h-multigrid and p-multigrid preconditioners
can be constructed by leveraging a hierarchy of discretizations and the
smoothers described above. This functionality is illustrated in <a href="../examples/#ex26">Example
26</a>.</p>
<h2 id="finite-element-operator-decomposition">Finite Element Operator Decomposition</h2>
<p>The partial assembly functionality in MFEM is based on decomposing the finite
element operator into a nested sequence of operations that act on different
levels of the discretization.</p>
<p>Finite element operators are typically defined through weak formulations of
partial differential equations that involve integration over a computational
mesh. The required integrals are computed by splitting them as a sum over the
mesh elements, mapping each element to a simple <em>reference</em> element (e.g. the
unit square) and applying a quadrature rule in reference space.</p>
<p>This sequence of operations highlights an inherent hierarchical structure
present in all finite element operators where the evaluation starts on <em>global
(trial) degrees of freedom (dofs) on the whole mesh</em>, restricts to <em>degrees of
freedom on subdomains</em> (groups of elements), then moves to independent <em>degrees
of freedom on each element</em>, transitions to independent <em>quadrature points</em> in
reference space, performs the integration, and then goes back in reverse order
to global (test) degrees of freedom on the whole mesh.</p>
<p>This is illustrated below for the case of a symmetric linear operator. We use
the notions <strong>T-vector</strong>, <strong>L-vector</strong>, <strong>E-vector</strong> and <strong>Q-vector</strong> to
represent the sets corresponding to the (true) degrees of freedom on the global
mesh, the split local degrees of freedom on the subdomains, the split degrees
of freedom on the mesh elements, and the values at quadrature points,
respectively.</p>
<p>We refer to the operators that connect the different types of vectors as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Subdomain restriction <strong>P</strong></li>
<li>Element restriction <strong>G</strong></li>
<li>Basis (Dofs-to-Qpts) evaluator <strong>B</strong></li>
<li>Operator at quadrature points <strong>D</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>More generally, if the operator is nonsymmetric or the test and trial space differ, then the
operators mapping back from quadrature points to test spaces may not be transposes of
<strong>P</strong>, <strong>G</strong> and <strong>B</strong>, but they still have the same basic structure and interpretation.</p>
<p><img alt="Operator Decomposition" src="../img/libceed.png" title="Operator Decomposition" /></p>
<p>Note that in the case of adaptive mesh refinement (AMR), the prolongation
operator <strong>P</strong> involves not only extracting sub-vectors, but evaluating values
at constrained degrees of freedom through the AMR interpolation. There can also
be several levels of subdomains (<strong>P1</strong>, <strong>P2</strong>, etc.), and it may be
convenient to split <strong>D</strong> as the product of several operators (<strong>D1</strong>, <strong>D2</strong>,
etc.).</p>
<h2 id="partial-assembly-in-mfem">Partial Assembly in MFEM</h2>
<p>Since the global operator <strong>A</strong> is just a series of variational restrictions
with <strong>B</strong>, <strong>G</strong> and <strong>P</strong>, starting from its point-wise kernel <strong>D</strong>, a
"matrix-vector product" with <strong>A</strong> can be performed by evaluating and storing
some of the innermost variational restriction matrices, and applying the rest
of the operators "on-the-fly". For example, one can compute and store a global
matrix on T-vector level. Alternatively, one can compute and store only the
subdomain (L-vector) or element (E-vector) matrices and perform the action of
<strong>A</strong> using matvecs with <strong>P</strong> or <strong>P</strong> and <strong>G</strong>. While these options are
natural for low-order discretizations, they are not a good fit for high-order
methods due to the amount of FLOPs needed for their evaluation, as well as the
memory transfer needed for a matvec.</p>
<p>MFEM's <strong>partial assembly</strong> functionality computes and stores only <strong>D</strong> (or
portions of it) and evaluates the actions of <strong>P</strong>, <strong>G</strong> and <strong>B</strong> on-the-fly.
Critically for performance, MFEM takes advantage of the tensor-product
structure of the degrees of freedom and quadrature points on quadrilateral and
hexahedral elements to perform the action of <strong>B</strong> without storing it as a
matrix. Note that the action of <strong>B</strong> is performed elementwise (it corresponds
to a block-diagonal matrix), and the blocks depend only on the element order
and reference geometry. Currently, only fixed order and geometry is supported,
meaning that all the blocks of <strong>B</strong> are identical.</p>
<p>The partial assembly algorithm requires the optimal amount of memory transfers
(with respect to the polynomial order) and near-optimal FLOPs for operator
evaluation. It consists of an operator <em>setup</em> phase, that evaluates and stores
<strong>D</strong> and an operator <em>apply</em> (evaluation) phase that computes the action of
<strong>A</strong> on an input vector. When desired, the setup phase may be done as a
side-effect of evaluating a different operator, such as a nonlinear residual.
The relative costs of the setup and apply phases are different depending on the
physics being expressed and the representation of <strong>D</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="parallel-decomposition">Parallel Decomposition</h3>
<p>After the application of each of the first three transition operators, <strong>P</strong>,
<strong>G</strong> and <strong>B</strong>, the operator evaluation is decoupled on their ranges, so
<strong>P</strong>, <strong>G</strong> and <strong>B</strong> allow us to "zoom-in" to subdomain, element and
quadrature point level, ignoring the coupling at higher levels.</p>
<p>Thus, a natural mapping of <strong>A</strong> on a parallel computer is to split the
<strong>T-vector</strong> over MPI ranks (a non-overlapping decomposition, as is typically
used for sparse matrices), and then split the rest of the vector types over
computational devices (CPUs, GPUs, etc.) as indicated by the shaded regions in
the diagram above.</p>
<p>One of the advantages of the decomposition perspective in these settings is
that the operators <strong>P</strong>, <strong>G</strong>, <strong>B</strong> and <strong>D</strong> clearly separate the MPI
parallelism in the operator (<strong>P</strong>) from the unstructured mesh topology
(<strong>G</strong>), the choice of the finite element space/basis (<strong>B</strong>) and the geometry
and point-wise physics <strong>D</strong>. These components also naturally fall in different
classes of numerical algorithms: parallel (multi-device) linear algebra for
<strong>P</strong>, sparse (on-device) linear algebra for <strong>G</strong>, dense/structured linear
algebra (tensor contractions) for <strong>B</strong> and parallel point-wise evaluations for
<strong>D</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="essential-boundary-conditions">Essential Boundary Conditions</h3>
<p>Essential boundary conditions for partially assembled operators are enforced
using the class <code>ConstrainedOperator</code> (or, for rectangular systems,
<code>RectangularConstrainedOperator</code>). These operators represent the action of the
partially assembled operator, together with specified constraints on essential
degrees of freedom. The <code>Operator</code> returned from, for example,
<code>BilinearForm::FormLinearSystem</code> or <code>BilinearForm::FormSystemMatrix</code> will in
fact be a <code>ConstrainedOperator</code>. The <code>Operator</code> returned from
<code>MixedBilinearForm::FormRectangularSystemMatrix</code> will be a
<code>RectangularConstrainedOperator</code>. These classes perform the matrix-free
equivalent of eliminating the rows and columns of the system matrix
corresponding to the essential degrees of freedom.</p>
<h2 id="partial-assembly-for-discontinuous-galerkin-methods">Partial Assembly for Discontinuous Galerkin methods</h2>
<p>A complementary partial assembly decomposition is used for Discontinuous
Galerkin methods to handle face terms, where a similar sequence of operators is
applied on the faces to compute the numerical fluxes. However, since elements
are decoupled, the element restriction <strong>G</strong> is the identity, and a face
restriction <strong>G<sub>F</sub></strong> is used instead to compute the numerical fluxes
and couple elements together. This face restriction <strong>G<sub>F</sub></strong> goes from
element degrees of freedom to face degrees of freedom. Then a <strong>B<sub>F</sub></strong>
operator can be applied on the faces. An analogous <strong>D<sub>F</sub></strong> operator
is then applied at the face quadrature points.</p>
<p>Currently, we support partial assembly only for Gauss-Lobatto and Bernstein
bases, with integrators that don't require derivatives on the faces.</p>
<h2 id="high-performance-templated-operators"><a href="../tperformance/">High-Performance Templated Operators</a></h2>
<p>MFEM also offers a set of templated classes to evaluate finite element
operators on tensor-product (quadrilateral and hexahedral) meshes, <a href="../tperformance/">described in
