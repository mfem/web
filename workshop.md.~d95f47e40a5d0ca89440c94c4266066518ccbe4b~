### Overview

The MFEM team is happy to announce the first MFEM Community Workshop, which will
take place on October 20, 2021, virtually, using WebEx for videoconferencing.
The goal of the workshop is to foster collaboration among all MFEM users and
developers, share the latest MFEM features with the broader community, deepen
application engagements, and solicit feedback to guide future development
directions for the project.

### Registration

If you plan to attend, [please register no later than **October 18th**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdVnFGMlkOtfHYNrm0oEBNLKI7Skba5WTBloZiZqh4MRfD73w/viewform).
There is no registration fee. WebEx details will be distributed to participants prior to the event date.

### Meeting format

Depending on the interest and user feedback, the meeting will include the following elements:

- Project news and development updates from the MFEM team
- An overview of the latest features in MFEM-4.3 and GLVis-4.1
- Contributed talks from application developers utilizing MFEM
- Roadmap discussion for future development
- Technical discussions in breakout rooms for Electromagnetics, Fluids, and
  Structural Mechanics applications

Workshop participants are encouraged to join the
[MFEM Community Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/mfemworkshop/shared_invite/zt-weieq6sh-yeu39dNdFRIKyGpoE2u9SQ)
to communicate with other MFEM users and developers before, during and after the
MFEM workshop.

The meeting activities will take place 7:45am-2:45pm Pacific Daylight Time (GMT-7):

### Simulation and Visualization Contest

We will be holding a simulation and visualization contest open to all attendees.
Participants can submit visualizations (images or videos) from MFEM-related
simulations. The winner of the competition (selected by the organizing
committee) will receive an MFEM T-shirt. We will also feature the images in the
[gallery](gallery.md).

To submit an entry in the contest, please fill out the
[Google form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeZBs2jwmWvdgZ9WED3nIlt0pCSqm-9lURbCtSFVQN5-9gGEA/viewform?usp=sf_link).

Alternatively, you may email your submission to
[mfem@llnl.gov](mailto:mfem@llnl.gov), including your name, institution, a short
description of the simulation (the underlying physics, discretization,
application details, etc.), and visualization software used (GLVis, ParaView,
VisIt, etc.).
