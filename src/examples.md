# Example Codes and Miniapps

This page provides a brief overview of MFEM's example codes and miniapps. For
detailed documentation of the MFEM sources, including the examples, see the
[online Doxygen documentation](https://docs.mfem.org),
or the `doc` directory in the distribution.

The goal of the example codes is to provide a step-by-step introduction to MFEM
in simple model settings. The miniapps are more complex, and are intended to be
more representative of the advanced usage of the library in physics/application
codes. We recommend that new users start with the example codes before moving to
the miniapps.

Select from the categories below to display examples and miniapps that contain the
respective feature. _All examples support (arbitrarily) high-order meshes and
finite element spaces_.
The numerical results from the example codes can be visualized using the
GLVis visualization tool (based on MFEM). See the
[GLVis website](https://glvis.org) for more details.

Users are encouraged to submit any example codes and miniapps that they have created and
would like to share. <br>

##Example 0: Simplest Laplace Problem
<img class="floatright" src="../img/examples/ex0.png">

This is the simplest MFEM example and a good starting point for new users.
The example demonstrates the use of MFEM to define and solve an $H^1$ finite
element discretization of the Laplace problem
$$-\Delta u = 1 \quad\text{in } \Omega$$
with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions
$$ u = 0 \quad\text{on } \partial\Omega$$

The example illustrates the use of the basic MFEM classes for defining the mesh,
finite element space, as well as linear and bilinear forms corresponding to the
left-hand side and right-hand side of the discrete linear system.

_The example has serial ([ex0.cpp](https://github.com/mfem/mfem/blob/master/examples/ex0.cpp))

##Example 1: Laplace Problem
<a href="https://glvis.org/live/?stream=../data/streams/ex1.saved" target="_blank">

This example code demonstrates the use of MFEM to define a simple isoparametric
finite element discretization of the Laplace problem $$-\Delta u = 1$$ with

finite element space coming from the mesh (linear by default, quadratic for
quadratic curvilinear mesh, NURBS for NURBS mesh, etc.) The problem solved in
this example is the same as [ex0](#ex0), but with more sophisticated options and
features.

The example highlights the use of mesh refinement, finite element grid
functions, as well as linear and bilinear forms corresponding to the left-hand
side and right-hand side of the discrete linear system. We also cover the
explicit elimination of essential boundary conditions, static condensation, and
the optional connection to the [GLVis](https://glvis.org) tool for visualization.

${\bf u}=0$ on the fixed part of the boundary with attribute 1, and
${\sigma}({\bf u})\cdot n = f$ on the remainder with $f$ being
a constant pull down vector on boundary elements with attribute 2, and zero
otherwise. The geometry of the domain is assumed to be as follows:

simple finite element discretization of the Laplace problem
$$-\Delta u = f$$ with homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. We
use high-order continuous trial space, a high-order interfacial

conditions through periodic meshes, as well as the use of
[GLVis](https://glvis.org) for persistent visualization of a time-evolving

##Example 15: Dynamic AMR
<img class="floatright" src="../img/examples/ex15.png">

Building on [Example 6](#ex6), this example demonstrates dynamic adaptive mesh refinement.
The mesh is adapted to a time-dependent solution by refinement
as well as by derefinement. For simplicity, the solution is
prescribed and no time integration is done. However, the error
estimation and refinement/derefinement decisions are realistic.

At each outer iteration the right hand side function is changed
to mimic a time dependent problem.  Within each inner iteration
the problem is solved on a sequence of meshes which are locally
refined according to a simple ZZ error estimator.  At the end
of the inner iteration the error estimates are also used to
identify any elements which may be over-refined and a single
derefinement step is performed.  After each refinement or
derefinement step a rebalance operation is performed to keep
the mesh evenly distributed among the available processors.

The example demonstrates MFEM's capability to refine, derefine
and load balance nonconforming meshes, in 2D and 3D, and on
linear, curved and surface meshes. Interpolation of functions
between coarse and fine meshes, persistent [GLVis](https://glvis.org) visualization,

##Example 17: DG Linear Elasticity
<img class="floatright" src="../img/examples/ex17.png">

This example code solves a simple linear elasticity problem
describing a multi-material cantilever beam using symmetric or
non-symmetric discontinuous Galerkin (DG) formulation.

Specifically, we approximate the weak form of
$$-{\rm div}({\sigma}({\bf u})) = 0$$
where
$${\sigma}({\bf u}) = \lambda\, {\rm div}({\bf u})\,I + \mu\,(\nabla{\bf u} + \nabla{\bf u}^T)$$
is the stress tensor corresponding to displacement field ${\bf u}$, and $\lambda$ and $\mu$
are the material Lame constants. The boundary conditions are
Dirichlet, $\bf{u}=\bf{u_D}$, on the fixed part of the boundary, namely
boundary attributes 1 and 2; on the rest of the boundary we use
${\sigma}({\bf u})\cdot n = {\bf 0}$. The geometry of the domain is assumed to be
as follows:

The example demonstrates the use of high-order DG vector finite
element spaces with the linear DG elasticity bilinear form,
meshes with curved elements, and the definition of piece-wise
constant and function vector-coefficient objects. The use of
non-homogeneous Dirichlet b.c. imposed weakly, is also
illustrated.

##Example 18: DG Euler Equations
<img class="floatright" src="../img/examples/ex18.png">

This example code solves the compressible Euler system of equations, a model
nonlinear hyperbolic PDE, with a discontinuous Galerkin (DG) formulation. The
primary purpose is to show how a transient system of nonlinear equations can be
formulated in MFEM. The equations are solved in conservative form

$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot {\bf F}(u) = 0$$

with a state vector $u = [ \rho, \rho v_0, \rho v_1, \rho E ]$, where $\rho$ is
the density, $v_i$ is the velocity in the $i^{\rm th}$ direction, $E$ is the
total specific energy, and $H = E + p / \rho$ is the total specific enthalpy.
The pressure, $p$ is computed through a simple equation of state (EOS) call.
The conservative hydrodynamic flux ${\bf F}$ in each direction $i$ is

$${\bf F_{\it i}} = \[ \rho v_i, \rho v_0 v_i + p \delta_{i,0}, \rho v_1 v_i + p \delta_{i,1}, \rho v_i H \]$$

Specifically, the example solves for an exact solution of the equations whereby
a vortex is transported by a uniform flow. Since all boundaries are periodic
here, the method's accuracy can be assessed by measuring the difference between
the solution and the initial condition at a later time when the vortex returns
to its initial location.

Note that as the order of the spatial discretization increases, the timestep
must become smaller. This example currently uses a simple estimate derived by
[Cockburn and Shu](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1012873910884)
for the 1D RKDG method. An additional factor can be tuned by passing the `--cfl`
(or `-c` shorter) flag.

The example demonstrates user-defined bilinear and nonlinear form integrators
for systems of equations that are defined with block vectors, and how these are
used with an operator for explicit time integrators. In this case the system
also involves an external approximate Riemann solver for the DG interface flux.
It also demonstrates how to use GLVis for in-situ visualization of vector grid
functions.

##Example 19: Incompressible Nonlinear Elasticity
<img class="floatright" src="../img/examples/ex19.png">

This example code solves the quasi-static incompressible nonlinear
hyperelasticity equations. Specifically, it solves the nonlinear equation
$$
\nabla \cdot \sigma(F) = 0
$$
subject to the constraint
$$
\text{det } F = 1
$$
where $\sigma$ is the Cauchy stress and $F_{ij} = \delta_{ij} + u_{i,j}$ is the deformation
gradient. To handle the incompressibility constraint, pressure is included as
an independent unknown $p$ and the stress response is modeled as an [incompressible
neo-Hookean hyperelastic solid](http://solidmechanics.org/text/Chapter3_5/Chapter3_5.htm).
The geometry of the domain is assumed to be as follows:

![](img/examples/ex19-domain.png)

This formulation requires solving the saddle point system
$$ \left[ \begin{array}{cc}
   K &B^T \\\\
   B & 0
\end{array} \right]
\left[\begin{array}{c} \Delta u \\\\ \Delta p \end{array} \right] =
\left[\begin{array}{c} R_u \\\\ R_p \end{array} \right]
$$
at each Newton step. To solve this linear system, we implement a specialized block
preconditioner of the form
$$
P^{-1} =
\left[\begin{array}{cc} I & -\tilde{K}^{-1}B^T \\\\ 0 & I \end{array} \right]
\left[\begin{array}{cc} \tilde{K}^{-1} & 0 \\\\ 0 & -\gamma \tilde{S}^{-1} \end{array} \right]
$$
where $\tilde{K}^{-1}$ is an approximation of the inverse of the stiffness matrix $K$ and
$\tilde{S}^{-1}$ is an approximation of the inverse of the Schur complement $S = BK^{-1}B^T$.
To approximate the Schur complement, we use the mass matrix for the pressure variable $p$.

The example demonstrates how to solve nonlinear systems of equations that are defined with
block vectors as well as how to implement specialized block preconditioners for use in
iterative solvers.

##Example 20: Symplectic Integration of Hamiltonian Systems
<img class="floatright" src="../img/examples/ex20.png">

This example demonstrates the use of the variable order, symplectic time
integration algorithm. Symplectic integration algorithms are designed to
conserve energy when integrating systems of ODEs which are derived from
Hamiltonian systems.

Hamiltonian systems define the energy of a system as a function of
time (t), a set of generalized coordinates (q), and their corresponding
generalized momenta (p).
$$
H(q,p,t) = T(p) + V(q,t)
$$
Hamilton's equations then specify how q and p evolve in time:
$$
\frac{dq}{dt} =  \frac{dH}{dp}\,,\qquad
\frac{dp}{dt} = -\frac{dH}{dq}
$$

To use the symplectic integration classes we need to define an `mfem::Operator`
${\bf P}$ which evaluates the action of dH/dp, and an
`mfem::TimeDependentOperator` ${\bf F}$ which computes -dH/dq.

This example visualizes its results as an evolution in phase space by defining
the axes to be $q$, $p$, and $t$ rather than $x$, $y$, and $z$.  In this space
we build a ribbon-like mesh with nodes at $(0,0,t)$ and $(q,p,t)$. Finally we
plot the energy as a function of time as a scalar field on this ribbon-like
mesh.  This scheme highlights any variations in the energy of the system.

This example offers five simple 1D Hamiltonians:

- Simple Harmonic Oscillator (mass on a spring)
  $$H = \frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{p^2}{m} + \frac{q^2}{k} \right)$$
- Pendulum
  $$H = \frac{1}{2}\left[ \frac{p^2}{m} - k \left( 1 - cos(q) \right) \right]$$
- Gaussian Potential Well
  $$H = \frac{p^2}{2m} - k e^{-q^2 / 2}$$
- Quartic Potential
  $$H = \frac{1}{2}\left[ \frac{p^2}{m} + k \left( 1 + q^2 \right) q^2 \right]$$
- Negative Quartic Potential
  $$H = \frac{1}{2}\left[ \frac{p^2}{m} + k \left( 1 - \frac{q^2}{8} \right) q^2 \right]$$

In all cases these Hamiltonians are shifted by constant values so that the
energy will remain positive. The mean and standard deviation of the computed
energies at each time step are displayed upon completion.

When run in parallel, each processor integrates the same Hamiltonian
system but starting from different initial conditions.

The problem is solved on a sequence of meshes which

or non-conforming (quadrilaterals, hexahedra) manner according
to a simple ZZ error estimator.

The example demonstrates MFEM's capability to work with both

In each case the field is driven by a forced oscillation, with
angular frequency $\omega$, imposed at the boundary or a portion
of the boundary.

PML was originally introduced by Berenger in ["A Perfectly Matched Layer for the
Absorption of Electromagnetic Waves"](https://doi.org/10.1006/jcph.1994.1159).
It is a technique used to solve wave propagation problems posed in infinite
domains. The implementation involves the introduction of an artificial absorbing
layer that minimizes undesired reflections. Inside this layer a complex
coordinate stretching map is used which forces the wave modes to decay
exponentially.

The example solves the indefinite Maxwell equations
$$\nabla \times (a \nabla \times E) - \omega^2 b E = f.$$
where $a = \mu^{-1} |J|^{-1} J^T J$, $b= \epsilon |J| J^{-1} J^{-T}$ and $J$ is
the Jacobian matrix of the coordinate transformation.

tolerance. In this example, the resolution is identified with a data oscillation
function on the mesh $\\mathcal{T}$, defined

operator, and the sum is taken over all elements $T$ in the mesh.

In this example, the coarse initial mesh is adaptively refined until $\\mathrm{osc}(f)$ is below a

##Mesh Optimizer Miniapp
<img class="floatright" src="../img/examples/mesh-optimizer.png">

This miniapp performs mesh optimization using the Target-Matrix Optimization
Paradigm (TMOP) by P.Knupp et al., and a global variational minimization
approach. It minimizes the quantity

$$\sum_T \int_T \mu(J(x)),$$

where $T$ are the target (ideal) elements, $J$ is the Jacobian of the
transformation from the target to the physical element, and $\mu$ is the mesh
quality metric.

This metric can measure shape, size or alignment of the region around each
quadrature point. The combination of targets and quality metrics is used to
optimize the physical node positions, i.e., they must be as close as possible to
the shape / size / alignment of their targets.

This code also demonstrates a possible use of nonlinear operators, as well as
their coupling to Newton methods for solving minimization problems. Note that
the utilized Newton methods are oriented towards avoiding invalid meshes with
negative Jacobian determinants. Each Newton step requires the inversion of a
Jacobian matrix, which is done through an inner linear solver.

  hexahedral elements (triangular and tetrahedral elements can also be used, but
  with the less efficient full assembly option). Serial and parallel mesh
  refinement options can be set via a command-line flag.

([schwarz_ex1p.cpp](https://github.com/mfem/mfem/blob/master/miniapps/gslib/schwarz_ex1p.cpp))
version that solves the
Poisson problem on overlapping grids. The serial version is restricted to use
two overlapping grids, while the parallel version supports arbitrary number of
overlapping grids.

- The _Navier Conjugate Heat Transfer_ miniapp in `miniapps/navier`
([navier_cht.cpp](https://github.com/mfem/mfem/blob/master/miniapps/navier/navier_cht.cpp))
demonstrates how a conjugate heat transfer problem can be solved with the fluid
dynamics (incompressible Navier-Stokes equations) and heat transfer
(advection-diffusion equation) PDEs modeled on different meshes.

_These miniapps require installation of the [`gslib`](https://github.com/gslib/gslib) library.
**We recommend that new users start with the example codes before moving to the miniapps.**_

##ParELAG AMGe for H(curl) and H(div) Miniapp
<img class="floatright" width="250" style="border:1px solid black" src="../img/examples/amge-2d-aes.png">

This is a miniapp that exhibits the **ParELAG** library and part of its
capabilities. The miniapp employs MFEM and ParELAG to solve $H(\\mathrm{curl})$-
and $H(\\mathrm{div})$-elliptic forms by an element based algebraic multigrid
(AMGe).

[ParELAG](https://github.com/LLNL/parelag) is a library mostly developed at the
Center for Applied Scientific Computing of Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory, California, USA.

The miniapp uses:

- A multilevel hierarchy of de Rham complexes of finite element spaces, built by
ParELAG;

- Hiptmair-type (hybrid) smoothers, implemented in ParELAG;

- AMS (Auxiliary-space Maxwell Solver) or ADS (Auxiliary-space Divergence
Solver), from HYPRE, for preconditioning or solving on the coarsest levels.

Alternatively, it is possible to precondition or solve the $H(\\mathrm{div})$
form on the coarsest level via a [hybridization](https://docs.mfem.org/html/classmfem_1_1Hybridization.html)
approach. However, this is not yet implemented in ParELAG for the coarse levels.
Only the hybridization solver that is directly applicable to an
$H(\\mathrm{div})$-$L^2$ mixed (saddle-point) system is currently available in
ParELAG.

We recommend viewing [ex3p.cpp](https://github.com/mfem/mfem/blob/master/examples/ex3p.cpp)
and [ex4p.cpp](https://github.com/mfem/mfem/blob/master/examples/ex4p.cpp)
before viewing this miniapp.

For more details, please see the
[documentation](https://github.com/mfem/mfem/blob/master/miniapps/parelag/README) in the `miniapps/parelag`
directory.

_This miniapp has only a parallel
([MultilevelHcurlHdivSolver.cpp](https://github.com/mfem/mfem/blob/master/miniapps/parelag/MultilevelHcurlHdivSolver.cpp)) version.
**We recommend that new users start with the example codes before
moving to the miniapps.**_
