The custom theme (variables.less + bootswatch.less) is a hybrid between the default
'flatly' and 'yeti' themes. The flatly files were taken as a basis and some sections
were replaced with their yeti counterparts.

To compile into CSS, download Bootswatch, copy variables.less and bootswatch.less
into custom/ and run 'grunt swatch:custom'.
