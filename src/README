The custom theme (variables.less + bootswatch.less) is a hybrid between the default
'flatly' and 'yeti' themes. The flatly files were taken as a basis and some sections
were replaced with their yeti counterparts.

To compile the LESS files into CSS:

1. Download Bootswatch:

   git clone git@github.com:thomaspark/bootswatch.git

2. Install lessc:

   npm install lessc

3. Compile the combined LESS files into CSS:

   npx lessc -x combined.less ../css/bootstrap-mfem.min.css
