### Overview

The MFEM team and Georgia Tech's School of Computational Science and Engineering are happy to
invite you to the 2026 MFEM Community Workshop, which will take place on September 22-25, 2026 in a
hybrid format: in-person at [Georgia Tech](#venue) + virtually on Zoom. The goal of
the workshop is to foster collaboration among all MFEM users and developers, share the latest MFEM
features with the broader community, deepen application engagements, and solicit feedback to guide
future development directions for the project. The first day of the workshop will include a hands-on MFEM tutorial.

### Simulation and Visualization Contest

We will be holding a simulation and visualization contest open to all attendees.
Participants can submit visualizations (images or videos) from MFEM-related
simulations. The winner of the competition (selected by the organizing
committee) will receive an MFEM T-shirt. We will also feature the images in the
[gallery](gallery.md). Here are the winners from the 2025 workshop:
