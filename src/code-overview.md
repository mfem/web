## Mesh

### Mesh

* Class `Mesh`.
* The mesh topology/connectivity is given by `element-to-vertex` relation.
* Elements have type (triangle, quadrilateral, tetrahedron, hexahedron, etc) and
  attribute (`int`).
* Boundary elements can be included allowing tagging of boundary subsets, e.g.
  for boundary conditions, by the boundary element attribute.
* Edges, faces, and other connectivity are derived automatically based on the
  element type.
* A high-order mesh uses a vector FE function, i.e. a vector
  [`GridFunction`](#grid-function), to represent its high-order _nodes_.
* Hanging/slave vertices are regular vertices - the mesh is _"cut"_ along
  non-conforming edges and faces.
* Conforming constraints and interpolation are added at the level of the
  [`FiniteElementSpace`](#finite-element-space) based on additional
  data from the `Mesh` and `NCMesh` objects.
* Local conforming refinement for triangles and tets.
* Local non-conforming refinement for triangles, quads, and hexes.
* De-refinement and parallel rebalancing for non-conforming meshes.
* Supports curve and surface meshes.
* Periodic meshes: periodic topology with a DG `GridFunction` as nodes, cut
  along the periodic edges/faces.

  quads and hexes.
